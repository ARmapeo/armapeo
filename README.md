AuGeo - Augmented Reality for ArcGIS

AuGeo, latin for augmented, is an [Esri Labs](http://labs.esri.com) initiative to explore the possibilities of using ArcGIS data in an augmented reality environment. Available to ArcGIS users for free in the iTunes (http://links.esri.com/esrilabs/augeo/ios) and Google Play (
	http://links.esri.com/esrilabs/augeo/android

) stores, the AuGeo mobile app allows you to easily bring data from your exiting ArcGIS point feature layers into an augmented reality mobile app.  Preparing your existing data for use within AuGeo is very straight-forward as described in this tutorial (http://links.esri.com/esrilabs/augeo/tutorial).

We at Esri Labs see many potential uses for Augmented Reality in GIS.  While we love maps, locating assets around you can be easier through the lenses of a camera on your phone or tablet. Through an augmented reality view, we can more intuitively represent hidden assets (underground, covered by vegetation or snow), reducing the time needed for people to find what they were looking for.  Will Augmented Reality help perform asset inspections more quickly?  Will it guide rescue teams towards a fire hydrant that otherwise would be missed?  Will if provide the ultimate mobile user experience for the most technology averse real estate agent? Will it be the foundation for the next tourist guide of your city?

As a Research Project from Esri Labs, our intent with Augeo is to make interesting technology available to you, so we can explore the possibilities together.  To start with AuGeo, all you need is an ArcGIS Online subscription, some data and a mobile device.    We would love to hear your feedback through our Github Repository (http://links.esri.com/esrilabs/augeo/github)  and evolve what already looks like a gold (Au) mine of possibilities. 

Are you a developer? AuGeo is built using AppStudio for ArcGIS (http://appstudio.esri.com) . The source code of this application will be made available once AppStudio 2.0 is released in July 2017 and will be available with the Standard  Edition of AppStudio for ArcGIS.
